# Recursion analysis of the Merge Sort algorithm
**Abstract**: Analysis of the recursion process of the Merge Sort algorithm.

## Background
Studying algorithm by Cormen et al. (2009) I was struggling to understanding specifically the merge sort algorithm. Inspire by Jeffrey Chastine (2014) approach (on a factorial recursive method), and using Mohit Kumra code (2022), I insert some print statements ir order to understand how the machine actually sort be the merge sort.
As expected, the code is very interpreted differently from an image of the book (Figure 2.4, p. 35): the machine doesn't draw the sorting process as a human would do, with all the dividing process concurrently — as the image suggests, though, despite this isn't stated in the text.

The code with the print statements is attached as a .py doc. The analysis itself is accessible [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hMwKHQ1tGzqifXslc4F69h0-Z5QtTbogdHb4F4Z1ul0/edit#) (in Portuguese) — search for "Quadro 4" or access the .pdf file attached.

Feel free to use my annotations, as a product of my own study of the book, including resolutions of exercises and problems.
